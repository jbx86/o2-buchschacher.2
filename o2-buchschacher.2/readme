This project simulates the writing of logs where multiple processes are trying to write to a single file.

A 'producer' process will read from a single text file, pick up the next line of text, and put it
in a buffer. There will 5 buffers that the producer will try to keep full and set flags to indicate
which buffers are full. The producer can only write to buffers that are empty.
The 'producer' process will "wake up" at random times to see if a buffer is free

A 'consumer' process will also run looking for buffers to be filled and write them to the log file
after making sure that the log file is not opened by another process.

The 'main' process will fork off a 'producer' and several 'consumer' processes, preform signal
handling, and memory allocation.  'main' takes a comandline argument for n (1-20, defaulting to 10)
to fork off a 'producer' process and n 'consumer' process.
